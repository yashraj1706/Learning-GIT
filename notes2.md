## **Section 2: Creating a Remote Repository and Pushing Local Commits to GitHub**

### **1. Introduction to Remote Repositories**

- Previously, we worked with local Git repositories.
- Remote repositories are hosted on external servers like **GitHub**.
- **GitHub** is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
- If you donâ€™t have an account, create one at **github.com** (free to use).

### **2. Creating a Repository on GitHub**

1. **Sign in** to GitHub.
2. Click the **(+)** icon at the top-right â†’ Select **New Repository**.
3. **Set repository details**:
   - **Repository name**: Example â€“ `Story`
   - **Description**: Optional
   - **Visibility**:
     - `Public` â€“ Anyone can see your files.
     - `Private` â€“ Only you (or permitted users) can access.
4. **Skip initializing a README** (we will push an existing local repository).
5. Click **Create Repository**.

### **3. Connecting Local Repository to GitHub**

- GitHub provides **two ways** to set up the repository:
  1. **GitHub Desktop** (not recommended).
  2. **Command Line (Recommended)**.

#### **Steps to Push a Local Repository to GitHub:**

1. **Check existing commits** (optional):

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

   - Displays commit history.

2. **Add a remote repository (link local to remote):**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository_url>
   ```

   - `origin` is a conventional name for the remote.
   - `<repository_url>` is copied from GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).

3. **Push commits to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - `-u` sets up tracking between local and remote repositories.
   - `origin` refers to the remote repository.
   - `main` is the branch being pushed.

#### **Possible Errors & Fixes:**

- **Error:** `src refspec main does not match any`
  - Likely causes:
    1. No commits exist in the local repository.
    2. Wrong branch name.
  - **Fix:** Ensure at least one commit exists:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin main
    ```

### **4. Verifying Push on GitHub**

- After `git push`, refresh GitHub to see your files.
- Navigate to **Commits â†’ Insights â†’ Network** to track repository changes.

### **5. Understanding Local & Remote Repositories**

- **Local Repository**: Exists on your computer.
- **Remote Repository**: Exists on GitHub.
- Both can be synced using `git push` (upload) and `git pull` (download).

### **6. Next Steps: Using .gitignore**

- `.gitignore` prevents sensitive files (API keys, passwords) from being uploaded.
- We will cover it in the next lesson.
